What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    
    A hidden .git directory is created storing metadata about a repository. 
    This metadata can be acessed using git commands after you start tracking files in your repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

    The staging are is a temporary storage area that you can add or remove
files from your working directory to it with the purpose of enabling tracking
and other version control operations on them. It's like a new layer on top of
your existing files in your working directory. Think of it as similar to
several word documents in a directory when you decide to enable tracking on
only few of them. This set of files would consist of the staging area in git.
