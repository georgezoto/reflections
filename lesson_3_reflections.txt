When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I would use a remote repository for two reasons. 
    One, to have another copy of my project as a backup on another system and location
    different than my local repository in my computer.
    Second, I would use it when I would collaborate with other users on a common project.
    This would benefit everyone to work towards a common goal and share your experience and 
    knowledge with other users online.
