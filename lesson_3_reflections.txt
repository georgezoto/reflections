When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I would use a remote repository for two reasons. 
    One, to have another copy of my project as a backup on another system and location
    different than my local repository in my computer.
    Second, I would use it when I would collaborate with other users on a common project.
    This would benefit everyone to work towards a common goal and share your experience and 
    knowledge with other users online.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    So that you can review first what changes are made in a remote, possibly public, repository
    before you pull them to your local repository. This way you can see if you are up to date with the
    remote branch and see if its a good idea for you to pull the new commits as part of the remote branch
    to your local repository.
